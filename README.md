Normally if you want to know how healthy is the food you are eating daily you have to manually keep track of this task just to mantain a perfectly balanced lifestyle, the team came up with this amazing idea to reduce this as much as possible applying image detection. This App is going to help you identify if you are having a healthy meal or not, as simple as that.

## What it does?

Integrating various types of knowledge, the user can check his/her food item using the Application and simply invoke the model created for this function which is designed to give details about what they are about to consume.
